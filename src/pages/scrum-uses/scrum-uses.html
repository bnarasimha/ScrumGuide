      Scrum was initially developed for managing and developing products. Starting in the early 1990s, Scrum has been used extensively, worldwide, to:

      Research and identify viable markets, technologies, and product capabilities;
      Develop products and enhancements;
      Release products and enhancements, as frequently as many times per day;
      Develop and sustain Cloud (online, secure, on-demand) and other operational environments for product use; and,
      Sustain and renew products.
      Scrum has been used to develop software, hardware, embedded software, networks of interacting function, autonomous vehicles, schools, government, marketing, managing the operation of organizations and almost everything we use in our daily lives, as individuals and societies.

      As technology, market, and environmental complexities and their interactions have rapidly increased, Scrumâ€™s utility in dealing with complexity is proven daily.

      Scrum proved especially effective in iterative and incremental knowledge transfer. Scrum is now widely used for products, services, and the management of the parent organization.

      The essence of Scrum is a small team of people. The individual team is highly flexible and adaptive. These strengths continue operating in single, several, many, and networks of teams that develop, release, operate and sustain the work and work products of thousands of people. They collaborate and interoperate through sophisticated development architectures and target release environments.

      When the words "develop" and "development" are used in the Scrum Guide, they refer to complex work, such as those types identified above.
