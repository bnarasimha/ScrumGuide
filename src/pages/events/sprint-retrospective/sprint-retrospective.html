      The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.
      <br /><br />
      The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes,
      tools, and their Definition of Done. Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work.
      <br />
      Assumptions that led them astray are identified and their origins explored. The Scrum Team discusses
      what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or
      were not) solved.
      <br /><br />
      The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful
      improvements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the
      next Sprint.
      <br /><br />
      The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a onemonth Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.
