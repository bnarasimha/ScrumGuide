      Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values:
      <br /><br />
      <i>
        <span style="font-size:15px; font-weight:bold">
        Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage
        </span>
      </i>
      <br /><br />
      The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other. Their primary focus is on
      the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals. The Scrum Team and its
      stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges. Scrum Team members respect each other to
      be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work. The
      Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.
      <br /><br />
      These values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behavior. The
      decisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values, not
      diminish or undermine them. The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with
      the Scrum events and artifacts. When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people
      they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life
      building trust.
