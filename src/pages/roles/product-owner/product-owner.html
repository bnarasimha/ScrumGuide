      The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of
      the Scrum Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.
      <br /><br />
      The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes:<br /><br />
      ● Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;<br />
      ● Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;<br />
      ● Ordering Product Backlog items; and,<br />
      ● Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.<br /><br />
      The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the
      Product Owner remains accountable.<br /><br />
      For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. These decisions
      are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at
      the Sprint Review.<br /><br />
      The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of
      many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by
      trying to convince the Product Owner.
