        The fundamental unit of Scrum is a small team of people, a Scrum Team. The Scrum Team consists of
        one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers. Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams
        or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal.
        <br /><br />
        Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value
        each Sprint. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and
        how.
        <br /><br />
        The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within
        a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people. In general, we have found that smaller teams communicate better
        and are more productive. If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into
        multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the
        same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner.
        <br /><br />
        The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration,
        verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else
        that might be required. They are structured and empowered by the organization to manage their own
        work. Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Teamâ€™s focus and consistency.
        <br /><br />
        The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint. Scrum
        defines three specific accountabilities within the Scrum Team: the Developers, the Product Owner, and
        the Scrum Master.
