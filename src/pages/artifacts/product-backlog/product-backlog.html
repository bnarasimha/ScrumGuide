      The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the
      single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.
      <br /><br />
      Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for
      selection in a Sprint Planning event. They usually acquire this degree of transparency after refining
      activities. Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog
      items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description,
      order, and size. Attributes often vary with the domain of work.
      <br /><br />
      The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner may
      influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs.

      <br /><br />
      The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team
      to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to
      define “what” will fulfill the Product Goal.

        A product is a vehicle to deliver value. It has a clear boundary, known stakeholders, well-defined
        users or customers. A product could be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract.
        </span>

      <br /><br />
      The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team. They must fulfill (or abandon) one
      objective before taking on the next.
