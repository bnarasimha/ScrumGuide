      An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all
      prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to
      provide value, the Increment must be usable.
      <br /><br />
      Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the
      Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders
      prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value.
      <br /><br />
      Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.
      <br /><br />
      
      <span style="font-size:18px">Commitment: Definition of Done</span>
      <br /><br />

      The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality
      measures required for the product.
      <br /><br />
      The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born.
      <br /><br />
      The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what
      work was completed as part of the Increment. If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of
      Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review. Instead, it returns to the Product
      Backlog for future consideration.
      <br /><br />
      If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams
      must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a
      Definition of Done appropriate for the product.
      <br /><br />
      The Developers are required to conform to the Definition of Done. If there are multiple Scrum Teams
      working together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done.
