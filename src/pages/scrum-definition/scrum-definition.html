      Scrum (n): A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

      Scrum is:
      
      Lightweight
      Simple to understand
      Difficult to master
      Scrum is a process framework that has been used to manage work on complex products since the early 1990s. Scrum is not a process, technique, or definitive method. Rather, it is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. Scrum makes clear the relative efficacy of your product management and work techniques so that you can continuously improve the product, the team, and the working environment.
      
      The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrumâ€™s success and usage.
      
      The rules of Scrum bind together the roles, events, and artifacts, governing the relationships and interaction between them. The rules of Scrum are described throughout the body of this document.
      
      Specific tactics for using the Scrum framework vary and are described elsewhere.
