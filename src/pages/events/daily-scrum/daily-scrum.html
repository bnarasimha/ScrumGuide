      The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint
      Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.
      <br /><br />
      The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is
      held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master
      are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.
      <br /><br />
      The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum
      focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work.
      This creates focus and improves self-management.
      <br /><br />
      Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and
      consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.
      <br /><br />
      The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet
      throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprintâ€™s
      work.
