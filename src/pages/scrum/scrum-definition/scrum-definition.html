      Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through
      adaptive solutions for complex problems.
      <br /><br />
      In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:
      <br /><br />
      1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.<br /><br />
      2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.<br /><br />
      3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.<br /><br />
      4. Repeat
      <br /><br />
      Scrum is simple. Try it as is and determine if its philosophy, theory, and structure help to achieve goals
      and create value. The Scrum framework is purposefully incomplete, only defining the parts required to
      implement Scrum theory. Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it. Rather
      than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and
      interactions.
      <br /><br />
      Various processes, techniques and methods can be employed within the framework. Scrum wraps
      around existing practices or renders them unnecessary. Scrum makes visible the relative efficacy of
      current management, environment, and work techniques, so that improvements can be made.
